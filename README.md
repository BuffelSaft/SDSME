# SDSME
Source code from Spiky's DS Map Editor

This repository contains updated source files from Spiky's DS Map Editor.

Feel free to download these files and edit them! However, please note the following:

-Development of SDSME by Spiky-Eared Pichu (the original creator of the tool) has been halted; while I don't know what Spiky's plans for SDSME were, I intend to develop the tool into an "all-in-one" editing suite for the DS-era Pok√©mon games.

-Current focus is on fixing bugs (e.g. the script editor doesn't save, the HGSS wild editor doesn't write some encounter rate data) and improving existing functionality

-The trainer editor and DPPt wild editor have been updated, and should be fully functional and safe to use

-Most of the code is quite messy and uncommented

-NOTE: I'm no longer actively working on this and it's unlikely I'll continue development any time soon.

Full credit for the bulk of the code goes to Spiky Eared Pichu, and other contributors to earlier versions of SDSME.
